You summon and kill... Summon and kill... I fail to see the logic here. Is sanity the price to pay for power!?
And your judgments interests me not. For I'm here... To reclaim... What is rightfully mine.
You will fumble in your opposition of my quest. Though I encourage! For an opportunity to battle a being of such grand delusions as you, is a sweet fortune!
